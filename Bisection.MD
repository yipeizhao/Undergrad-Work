A Matlab script to find the root of a function using the bisection method.<br/>
Four parameters will be asked:<br/>
Starting interval a; Ending interval b; Accetable Error delta and maximum number of iteration m.<br/>
The preset function is f(x)=exp(x)-sin(x)<br/>
It should work for any given function as long as it has a valid root.<br/>

Output:
- Two figures: plots of absolute error and relative error
- Writing a text file which stores all errors at each time step
