# Undergrad-Work
Codes I wrote during my undergraduate study.<br/>
Presented only for reference and demonstrating purposes.<br/>
Feel free to use them if you feel comfortable, there is no specific copyright for them, but please mention me at least.<br/>
You can be inspired by my code but DO NOT COPY AND PASTE THEM FOR YOUR ASSIGNMENT!<br/>
All codes are wrote by myself, some of them are inspired by public resources.<br/>
Please drop me an email if you found anything interested about my code or myself.<br/>
